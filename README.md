# Macro-Click
 An autoclicker/macro creation program with a GUI.

 This program may be useful for someone wanting to auto run a task in a game that is repetetive.
 
 You can save your macros and load them and add to them.

 Delays are important to add in between inputs otherwise the macro you create may not run as expected.

 For the autoclicking feature:
 To use the autoclicker type in delay in seconds in the box that reads(Delay Between Clicks) you can input as a float. The default key is z or you can set it in the box below the delay. You can also specify right mouse button to click instead. Then click the Autoclick button and hit z or whatever key you specified and it will start clicking. Also setting it to z manually will start autoclicking as soon as you press autoclick.

 For the macro command feature:
 Press the Add Command button.
 Then decide between adding a delay, key input, or mouse input.
    For Delay:
        Just enter the amount of seconds in the box that appears.
    For Keyboard Input:
        You must specify to Press, Release, or Click the key that you specify in the Keyboard key box.
    For Mouse Input:
        Similar to the keyboard input but you don't have to specify to Press, Release, or Click it. Instead you may decide to move the cursor on the screen.
 Once you have added your commands or have filled up the screen with commands, press the Confirm Before Running Command. Before doing this however, make sure that all your boxes that you need are checked and that you have typed everything correctly. Without those two requirements your macro won't work. When you press confirm your commands are saved and you can either continue add to them or you may run your macro.

 To run your macro you must first click the confirm button and then the Apply Macro Settings button. Then which ever key you specified or z if you went default. That will start your macro. Pressing z or your specified key will stop the macro but not immediately. It will only stop your macro when it's finished running through the end. If you don't want it to loop, just add z or your specified key at the end of your macro aas a Click. Then it will stop.

 I hope you enjoy this fun side project I had. I'm not sure how often the code will be updated if at all.
