# Macro-Click
 An autoclicker/macro creation program with a GUI.

 This program may be useful for someone wanting to auto run a task in a game that is repetetive.
 
 You can save your macros and load them and add to them.

 Delays are important to add in between inputs otherwise the macro you create may not run as expected.

Updated the program to be easier to use. Instead of having to press a bunch of buttons like before, now all one has to do is type each command in brackets which I personally find much easier. Now there are only five buttons total and you only need one to use the program . To get started I put in a few default commands to show how it works. Also updated the help button to be more useful.

There is now support for matching image templates, so you can snip a .jpg from your screen and use that to later click on that portion of the screen. You can also use the click_color command to find and click the average color of a snipped .jpg. Added a MacroExamples folder so you can load in and see how more complicated commands work. For some of those you may need to add folders and images to the proper directories to see how they work. Also added a snip image button that allows you to screenshot and snip out a section and save it to .jpg.

 I hope you enjoy this fun side project I had. I'm not sure how often the code will be updated if at all.
