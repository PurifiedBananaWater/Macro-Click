# Macro-Click
 An autoclicker/macro creation program with a GUI.

 This program may be useful for someone wanting to auto run a task in a game that is repetetive.
 
 You can save your macros and load them and add to them.

 Delays are important to add in between inputs otherwise the macro you create may not run as expected.

 I hope you enjoy this fun side project I had. I'm not sure how often the code will be updated if at all.
